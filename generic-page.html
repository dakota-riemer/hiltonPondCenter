  				<img src ="images\homepage.png"/>
					<p>This is a screenshot of the homepage on the Hilton Pond website. I've included it in my research because it shows the logo, page background and
						basic page layout for their entire website. Everything follows this form.
					</p>
			<img src ="images\mainpage.png"/>
			<p> This is a screenshot from Hilton Pond's website, it shows what the main page looks like. They have a homepage that you are brought to first, and then
				a seperate 'main page' that has some branding for their newsletter page.
			</p>
			<img src ="images\newsletter.png"/>
			<p> This is a screenshot from their newsletter webpage, which does not match their branding on the previous page. It matches the website in general but
				it does match where the mainpage already talked about the newsletter.
			</p>
			<img src ="images\hilton pond banding station.jpg"/>
			<p> This was an image I found when searching for Hilton Pond on Google. It was not anywhere on their website that I was able to find but the website is
				very big. I think that it is from another article mention on a different site.
			</p>
			<img src="images\hilton pond associated image.png"/>
			<p> This was another image I found on Google that was labeled as the Hilton Pond Center for 'Piedmond Natural History' which is just the full name of the
				foundation. I am not sure where this image was used but it is associated with a research inititive for humming birds.
			</p>
			<img src ="images\ariel image.jpg"/>
			<p> This was another image I found on Google that shows an ariel view of the property as well as branding for their organization.
			</p>
      <img src="images\articlemention.png"/>
			<p> This is an screenshot of a article written by the leader of the organziation that shows him wearing a shirt for their hummingbird project. It has the
				same stlye and branding as the website.
			</p>
			<img src ="images\article.jpg"/>
			<p> This is an image from another article by a different site that mentions Hilton Pond Center.</p>
