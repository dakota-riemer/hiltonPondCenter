					<h2>Primary Reseach</h2>
  				<img height="300px" src ="images\homepage.png"/>
					<p>This is a screenshot of the homepage on the Hilton Pond website. I've included it in my research because it shows the logo, page background and
						basic page layout for their entire website. Everything follows this form.
					</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\mainpage.png"/>
			<p> This is a screenshot from Hilton Pond's website, it shows what the main page looks like. They have a homepage that you are brought to first, and then
				a seperate 'main page' that has some branding for their newsletter page.
			</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\newsletter.png"/>
			<p> This is a screenshot from their newsletter webpage, which does not match their branding on the previous page. It matches the website in general but
				it does match where the mainpage already talked about the newsletter.
			</p>
			<img src ="images\hilton pond banding station.jpg"/>
			<p> This was an image I found when searching for Hilton Pond on Google. It was not anywhere on their website that I was able to find but the website is
				very big. I think that it is from another article mention on a different site.
			</p>
			<img height="300px" src="images\hilton pond associated image.png"/>
			<p> This was another image I found on Google that was labeled as the Hilton Pond Center for 'Piedmond Natural History' which is just the full name of the
				foundation. I am not sure where this image was used but it is associated with a research inititive for humming birds.
			</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\ariel image.jpg"/>
			<p> This was another image I found on Google that shows an ariel view of the property as well as branding for their organization.
			</p>
      <img height="300px" src="images\articlemention.png"/>
			<p> This is an screenshot of a article written by the leader of the organziation that shows him wearing a shirt for their hummingbird project. It has the
				same stlye and branding as the website.
			</p>
			<img src ="images\article.jpg"/>
			<p> This is an image from another article by a different site that mentions Hilton Pond Center.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\Frame Your Design Challenge.jpg"/>

			<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
			<img src ="images\p2 secondary research\most recent fb post.jpg"/>
			<p>This is an image of the most recent post from their Facebook page. It is the most updated information across all their online platforms. There is not a
				whole lot going on with their website due to covid-19 and the face that the last newletter came out at the beginning of the month.</p>
			<img src ="images\p2 secondary research\most recent newsletter post.jpg"/>
			<p>This is an image of their most recent newsletter post. It shows what this organization has most recently been up to, which is mainly just categorizing the
				flora and fauna of the area.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\people posting about hpc.jpg"/>
			<p>This image shows what kind of people are looking at this organization and what for. This example is a Facebook post by a homeschool teacher showing how <thead>
				organization can be a research tool.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\top fans of fb page.jpg"/>
			<p>This image shows the main followers of Hilton Pond's Facebook page. From here I was able to look at each of these people's individual profiles to figure who
				they are and what their connection to Hilton Pond might be. It gave me good inside of who my main demographic will be for the resdesign on the website.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\successful websites.jpg"/>
			<p>This is another non-profit organization for sustainable living and environmental care. I think its design is very successful for what it is trying to <!DOCTYPE html>
			and somethign similar would also work for my design</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\successful web organzation.jpg"/>
			<p>This image is a screenshot from the same website mentioned above, but it is specifically of the important information usually found at the bottom of the webpage. I
				really like how this website solved this issue because I know Hilton Pond really needs to have that problem solved.</p>
