					<h2>Primary Reseach</h2>

					<p>This is a screenshot of the homepage on the Hilton Pond website. I've included it in my research because it shows the logo, page background and
						basic page layout for their entire website. Everything follows this style and use of Comic Sans.
					</p>

					<h4>Left &amp; Right</h4>
					<div>
					<p><span class="image left"><img height="200px" width="300px" src="images\mainpage.png" alt="" /></span>This image is a screenshot of Hilton Pond Center's main page, just after the header information and navigation. It shows the important news for the week, current updates, and button for their weekly newsletter that points to a different box about humming birds. Everything commands attention and equal importance because everything is brightly colored or bolded in some way. This is pretty typically information one might find on a homepage, however it is very hard to visually sift through to find what you are looking for.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><span class="image right"><img height="200px" width="200px" src="images\newsletter.png" alt="" /></span>This screenshot is of the newsletter sign-up page. When you click "Weekly Happenings" on the homepage, it takes you to the newletter sign up page, not the actual newsletter. The newsletter is located on a different page entirely and I only found that by accident. This page includes a different logo that could be considered to be on brand with the rest of the website, however it feels more like an accident then on purpose. </p>

				<h4>Images associated with Hilton Pond Center</h4>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\article.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\hilton pond associated image.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\articlemention.png" alt="" /></span></div>

							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\hilton pond banding station.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<p>These images came up when searching "Hilton Pond Center" into Google. They can either be found on Hilton Pond's website or their Facebook page. I chose to include these images in my research because they is little to no branding for this organization and any image associated with them is an close as I was going to get as far as consistent branding was concerned.</p>

			<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
			<img src ="images\p2 secondary research\most recent fb post.jpg"/>
			<p>This is an image of the most recent post from their Facebook page. It is the most updated information across all their online platforms. There is not a
				whole lot going on with their website due to covid-19 and the face that the last newletter came out at the beginning of the month.</p>
			<img src ="images\p2 secondary research\most recent newsletter post.jpg"/>
			<p>This is an image of their most recent newsletter post. It shows what this organization has most recently been up to, which is mainly just categorizing the
				flora and fauna of the area.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\people posting about hpc.jpg"/>
			<p>This image shows what kind of people are looking at this organization and what for. This example is a Facebook post by a homeschool teacher showing how <thead>
				organization can be a research tool.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\top fans of fb page.jpg"/>
			<p>This image shows the main followers of Hilton Pond's Facebook page. From here I was able to look at each of these people's individual profiles to figure who
				they are and what their connection to Hilton Pond might be. It gave me good inside of who my main demographic will be for the resdesign on the website.</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\successful websites.jpg"/>
			<p>This is another non-profit organization for sustainable living and environmental care. I think its design is very successful for what it is trying to <!DOCTYPE html>
			and somethign similar would also work for my design</p>
			<img height="300px" src ="images\p2 secondary research\successful web organzation.jpg"/>
			<p>This image is a screenshot from the same website mentioned above, but it is specifically of the important information usually found at the bottom of the webpage. I
				really like how this website solved this issue because I know Hilton Pond really needs to have that problem solved.</p>

			<h2>Audience Research</h2>
			<img height="700px" src ="images\audience research post it.jpg"/>
			<p>This image shows the research I had done on my audience and everyone involved in my project, either directly or indirectly.</p>
			<img height="600px" src ="images\goals for Hilton Pond Center.jpg"/>
			<p>This is a table I made outlining the overarching and specific goals for the client, audience, and website.</p>

			<h2>Interviews</h2>
			<img height="800px" src ="images\Interviews for Hilton Pond-03.jpg"/>
			<p>This interview was conducted over the phone with Dr. Hilton. He is the founder of the organization and the creator of the website.<p/>
			<img height="800px" src ="images\Interviews for Hilton Pond-02.jpg"/>
			<p>This interview was over email with Dr. Shuman, who is the President of the Hilton Pond Centerâ€™s board of trustees. While he is a part of the organization directly, he regularly interacts with the website to edit the weekly newsletter.</p>
			<img height="800px" src ="images\Interviews for Hilton Pond-01.jpg"/>
			<p>This interview was with Lynn Biasini, a top fan of the website and the organization. She is a regular user of the website and does not work within the organization. She works in the field on environmental conservation so she goes to Hilton Pond Center to learn more about the flora and fauna in the area.</p>
