					<h2>Primary Reseach</h2>

					<p>The homepage of Hilton Pond Center's website (above) is a picture-perfect look into the kind of design and branding that a viewer will find throughout the website. On this page there are bright colors, pixelated images, and the use of almost entirely Comic Sans, much light every other page in the website with changes to color only.
					</p>

					<h4>Significant Pages</h4>
					<div>
					<p><span class="image left"><img height="200px" width="200px" src="images\mainpage.jpg" alt="" /></span>This image is a screenshot of Hilton Pond Center's main page, just after the header information and navigation. It shows the important news for the week, current updates, and button for their weekly newsletter that points to a different box about humming birds. Everything commands attention and equal importance because everything is brightly colored or bolded in some way. This is pretty typically information one might find on a homepage, however it is very hard to visually sift through to find what you are looking for.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><span class="image right"><img height="200px" width="200px" src="images\newsletter.jpg" alt="" /></span>This screenshot is of the newsletter sign-up page. When you click "Weekly Happenings" on the homepage, it takes you to the newletter sign up page, not the actual newsletter. The newsletter is located on a different page entirely and I only found that by accident. This page includes a different logo that could be considered to be on brand with the rest of the website, however becuase of the style of the image used for the logo, it looks as though it was found on clip art in outdated versions of PowerPoint. Not to mention that everything is noticeably pixelated, making the overall design of the website feel haphazard and somewhat unprofessional. The content itself is the saving grace of the website. </p>

				<h4>Images associated with Hilton Pond Center</h4>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\article.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\hpAssociated.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\articlemention.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\publicationPage.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<p>These images came up when searching "Hilton Pond Center" into Google, save for the image on the bottom right. That is a screenshot taken from the publications page. It shows a completely different color pallet and design than the other pages and was worth mentioning in this stage of the research. They can either be found on Hilton Pond's website or their Facebook page. I chose to include these images in my research because they is little to no branding for this organization and any image associated with them is an close as I was going to get as far as consistent branding was concerned.</p>

				<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\p2 secondary research\sharedBy.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\p2 secondary research\mostRecentFB.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\p2 secondary research\mostRecentNews.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\p2 secondary research\goodFooter.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<p>These images were taken as part of the secondary research. They explore who is looking at the website, the post recent posts on the website or the Hilton Pond Facebook page, and it allowed me to start thinking about the audience. The last two images are from a different organization's website on sustainability. Their website has very effective organization and branding and I was looking at their website to understand what a good site needs in order to be effective.</p>

			<img height="800px" src ="images\Interviews for Hilton Pond-02.jpg"/>
			<p>This interview was over email with Dr. Shuman, who is the President of the Hilton Pond Centerâ€™s board of trustees. While he is a part of the organization directly, he regularly interacts with the website to edit the weekly newsletter.</p>
			<img height="800px" src ="images\Interviews for Hilton Pond-01.jpg"/>
			<p>This interview was with Lynn Biasini, a top fan of the website and the organization. She is a regular user of the website and does not work within the organization. She works in the field on environmental conservation so she goes to Hilton Pond Center to learn more about the flora and fauna in the area.</p>
