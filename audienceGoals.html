						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\goalsHPC.jpg" alt="" /></span>This table was created to show the overarching goals that client, audience, and website should have, as well we as the specific goals that concern the different kinds of users of the website. It was important to think specifically on the different types of users becuase like Dr. Hilton mentioned in our interview, he hopes to reach people of all ages. This is a vast group of people to create a website for, so I narrowed down some specific groups that could apply to several ages. Those groups included teachers, both homeschool and public. I also included universities, as well as high school or college students because what the university would be using the website for is probably different from what the student will be accessing the website for, so their goals will de different as well. These three groups are largly who will be looking at the website, so it was important to think about goals concerning these groups.
